Title: Estimates Fisher's Exact P-values
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Eric San Miguel, Fernando Morales
Maintainer: The package maintainer <eric.sanmiguel@psu.edu>
Description: This package estimates the p-values under sharp null hypotheses using the procedure proposed by Fisher (1935). The package contains functions to estimate p-values for additive sharp null hypotheses using different functions for test statistics. Moreover, the functions provided also estimate and plot the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. Finally, tha package also contains a function that allows the user to estimate confidence intervals using the distribution of the test statistic.
